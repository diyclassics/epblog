	abstract = {Word repetition was a crucial feature in Latin poetry, but most scholars discuss it only in footnotes. In this study, Wills examines how this figure was in over 10,000 quotations across the whole gamut of Latin poetry from Ennius to Juvenal. Embracing a number of hot topics such as intertextual reference, allusion, and genre, this will be a major contribution to Latin literary scholarship.},
